Bio
=========

Iâ€™m a 2nd year Mathematics Ph.D. student at UCLA. My recent research is in graph-based semisupervised learning and its synergy with feature representations learned by convolutional neural networks. When combined with active learning (and even without), these techniques can outperform the state-of-the-art in some image classification tasks with significantly less label information (i.e. less training data). For the 2021-2022 academic year, I was supported by the NSF NRT MENTOR Fellowship. For undergrad I went to Tufts University, graduating Summa Cum Laude with degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering and was a Captain on the Varsity Rowing Team. 

In Summer 2021, I was a Graduate Data Science Intern at the Mitre Corporation, working on multivariate drift detection. 

I am looking for research/applied scientist internship roles for Summer 2023. Feel free to contact me via the sidebar to the left.

Hobbies/Personal
=================
I was a rower in high school and college and have continued to do endurance sports since then. Right now, I'm training for the LA Marathon in March 2023 and hope to start doing triathlons soon as well. I'm also a huge sports fan, including the NBA, NFL, college basketball and football, soccer, and pro cycling.
