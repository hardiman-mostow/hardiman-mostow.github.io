Bio
=========

Iâ€™m a 3rd year Mathematics Ph.D. student at UCLA, supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research is in graph-based semisupervised learning. I've done projects inventing novel neural network architectures that leverage graph SSL for image classification, and am currently working on a project on hyperspectral image unmixing. I'm also interested in the theoretical and empirical relationship between graph SSL techniques and graph neural networks. For undergrad I went to Tufts University, graduating Summa Cum Laude with degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering and was a Captain on the Varsity Rowing Team. 

In Summer 2021, I was a Graduate Data Science Intern at the Mitre Corporation, working on multivariate drift detection. 

I am looking for research/applied scientist internship roles for Summer 2024. Feel free to contact me via the sidebar to the left.

Hobbies/Personal
=================
I was a rower in high school and college and have continued to do endurance sports since then. Now I enjoy training for marathons and hope to start doing triathlons soon as well. I'm also a huge sports fan, including the NBA, NFL, college basketball and football, soccer, and pro cycling.
