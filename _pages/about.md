Bio
=========

Iâ€™m a 4th year Mathematics Ph.D. student at UCLA, supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and advised by [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/). My recent research is in deep learning and graph-based semisupervised learning theory and algorithms, and their applications to both remote and quantum sensing. In particular, I'm interested in environmental and climate-focused applications. 

In Summer 2024, I was a research intern at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, building a transformer-based model for damage mapping after natural disasters (landslides, fires, floods) with global synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. I was mentored by [Charlie Marshak](https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/charlie-marshak) and [Al Handwerger](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/person/Alexander_Handwerger).

For undergrad I went to Tufts University, graduating Summa Cum Laude with degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering and was a Captain on the Varsity Rowing Team. I was advised by [James Murphy](https://jmurphy.math.tufts.edu).

I am looking for research/applied scientist internship roles for Summer 2025. Feel free to contact me via the sidebar to the left.

Hobbies/Personal
=================
I was a rower in high school and college and have continued to do endurance sports since then. Now I enjoy training for marathons, cycling, and hope to start doing triathlons soon. I'm also a huge sports fan, including the NBA, NFL, college basketball and football, soccer, and pro cycling.
